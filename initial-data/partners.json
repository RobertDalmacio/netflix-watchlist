The duo were separated during the early days of the outbreak, which was caused by the Umbrella Corporation's new antidepressant – Joy – that contains the T-virus, the man-made mutagenic that turns humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Oh, and other living creatures into all kinds of horrifying monsters.",
